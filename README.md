This is a kind of Toy Shop Website Project.
This is a Very Interesting Project I learned a lot in this project.

## The Steps
    * In This Project First i have to choose a design, so i just go & take a look in theme forest in there i got something close to my project idea.
    * But I didn't find exact same design i wanted, so i just took some hints from that site, and started my work.
    *First i open my vs code and then designed the meaningful header and the footer. 
    *After that opened i worked on Firebase Authentication.
    * And then Comes the tricky part about backend, i got confused and start scrolling on the group and after 30 mins i got the idea and Start the backend part.
    * After Connecting to mongoDB and define the environment key, i started the design part and also make some data.
    * I have done GET POST PUT DELETE and Options, In short The CRUD operations Finally Get Over.
    * And Now all work are Done.
* Now I'm Going to Show my Website's Live server---
